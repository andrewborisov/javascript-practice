## Prerequisites

`npm i` to install jest and lint

## Exercises with arrays

To run check your solutions use `npm run testArrays`. <br>
Also, you can check mine by running `npm run testArraysSolutions`.

#### List of tasks
1. <b>fill</b> - Write a method that creates a new array with given values.
2. <b>reverse</b> - Write a method that reverts input array.
3. <b>compact</b> - Write a method that clears array from all unnecessary elements, like false, undefined, empty strings, zero, null.
4. <b>fromPairs</b> - Write a method that returns an object composed of key-value pairs.
5. <b>without</b> - Write a method that returns an array without listed values.
6. <b>unique</b> - Write a method that returns a duplicate-free array.
7. <b>isEqual</b> - Write a method that makes a shallow compare of two arrays and returns true if they are identical.
8. <b>flatten</b> - Write a method that turns a deep array into a plain array.
9. <b>chunk</b> - Write a method that splits an array into parts of determined size.
10. <b>intersection</b> - Write a method that creates an array of unique values that are included in all given arrays.

## Exercises with objects

To run check your solutions use `npm run testObjects`. <br>
Also, you can check mine by running `npm run testObjectsSolutions`.

#### List of tasks
1. <b>isPlainObject</b> - Write a method that verifies argument is a plain object, not an array or null
2. <b>makePairs</b> - Write a method that returns a deep array like [[key, value]]
3. <b>without</b> - Write a method that returns new object without provided properties
4. <b>isEmpty</b> - Write a method that makes a shallow check is object empty
5. <b>isEqual</b> - Write a method that makes a shallow compare of two objects
6. <b>invoke</b> - Write a method that invokes an array method on a specific path
7. <b>isEmptyDeep</b> - Write a method that makes a deep check is an object empty
8. <b>isEqualDeep</b> - Write a method that makes a deep compare of two objects
9. <b>intersection</b> - Write a method that finds shallow intersections of objects
10. <b>intersectionDeep</b> - Write a method that finds all intersections of objects
